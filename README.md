# Intro
This is a discord bot which will create the fairest matchup of players if you enter 10 faceit account links.

# How to use
1. Download/Clone this repository
2. `npm install`
3. rename `config.example.json` to `config.json` and set options
   - you _need_ to set `faceit_api_key`, `discord_bot_token` and `discord_channel_id`
4. `npm start`

# Commands
1. `reset` this command will reset the player selection process
2. `status` this command will display the current status
3. `test` if you specified `test_players` in config, this will create two teams out of these players
